## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:dpsec26/mc-server.git
```

2. Create (or copy) the `.env` file
```sh
cp example.env .env
```

3. Start the container via Docker Compose

docker compose up -d
```

## Usage

### Server configuration

The `server.properties` file contains a few common settings for the server.
You can change them as you like or even add new ones.
For the full list of settings or more information, please refer to the [Minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Server.properties).

### Start and stop the container

To start the container you can use
```sh
# use -d for detached mode
docker compose up -d
```

Your Minecraft server is now available under `<your-ip>`.
If you changed the the `MC_SERVER_PORT` in the `.env` you need to specify it. Example: `localhost:12345`

To stop the container use
```sh
docker compose down
```

### Access log files

You can access the log files while the container is running with
```sh
docker compose logs mc-server
```
